# The Doomsday Machine: Beginnings

So it's another Tuesday in 2020, and honestly, all the days are just blending together with these endless pandemic lockdowns. But here's something a bit strange I've stumbled upon lately: there's talk on some deep web forums about a group called "Nexus Innovations" that's quietly pulling people from the hacker and open-source worlds. The weirdest part? Once someone joins them, they pretty much disappear off the map.

Let me set the scene a bit. I’m Freddie, but at the McDonald's where I’ve been managing shifts for nearly two decades, some folks still call me “Fries.” I’m not too keen on that nickname, though. When I'm not at work, I spend my time really diving into things like quantum physics, computer science, math, linguistics, philosophy, and psychology. I also hang around online as "QuantumBurger," where I explore these subjects. It's not about showing off; it’s just what I love to do, you know? It feels like grabbing pieces of a massive puzzle.

This one peculiar Tuesday, I find this incredibly fancy piece of paper on my doormat—it’s the kind of fancy that you just have to pick up and look at. One side is stamped with "Join the club" in this super slick font, and the other side just sports a mysterious black QR code.

I give the QR code a scan, and boom, my phone displays this message:

```
"Freddie (or should we say, QuantumBurger),

The world’s kind of a mess right now, and the standard solutions just aren’t cutting it. Over at Nexus Innovations, we’re all about tossing out the playbook and trying something fresh. We’ve noticed you're into discussing some pretty deep topics.

We’re thinking you might want to step out of the day-to-day and help us tackle something big—something others might call a 'Doomsday Machine.' We see it as a chance to maybe change things for the better.

If you’re up for it, follow this link and let’s get into it.

It’s totally up to you, but remember: sometimes it's the unexpected paths that lead to the most interesting places.

That's pretty wild, right? They're talking about a "Doomsday Machine Club," which sounds intense but also kind of thrilling. Here I am, just a regular guy who likes to think about big questions, and suddenly I've got this opportunity to maybe do something meaningful. Do I stick with what’s familiar, or take this leap into the unknown? 

Yeah... so... I opened that link on my phone, and I swear, ALL my stuff started to upgrade, laptop, desktop, everything. They were already in there, ready. Just waiting.

Since you are here now, you got the same piece of paper. I left this message for you, I will try to contact you again soon. 

I can't really tell you anything now, except trust no one, I mean it. NO ONE.
