Don't freak out. Just read this, trust me. 

I’m Freddie, I got the same message as you did. I accepted just like you did. 
Until two years ago I had been working at the same McDonald's managing shifts for nearly two decades, some folks still call me “Fries.”... 

I am still trying to figure out what makes them pick certain people, I have have met so many different types... Look, I am not a genious, I just spend my time really diving into things like math, physics, computer science, linguistics, philosophy, and psychology. It's just my journey to understand the world, but for some reason what I found is of value here. 

Anyway, for me the message came on a Tuesday in august of 2020, or something like that.. 

All the days were just blending together cuz of the endless pandemic lockdowns. But I remember it was around that time I had just stumbled upon messages on forums about the group called "Nexus Innovations" that's was pulling people from the hacker and open-source worlds. The weirdest part was the radio silence once they got people on the payroll.

I was just going back from work and I  find this incredibly fancy piece of paper on my doormat—it’s the kind of fancy that you just have to pick up and look at. One side is stamped with "Join the club" in this super slick font, and the other side just sports a mysterious black QR code.

I gave the QR code a scan, and boom, my phone displays this message:

```
"Freddie (or should we say, QuantumBurger),

The world’s kind of a mess right now, and the standard solutions just aren’t cutting it. Over at Nexus Innovations, we’re all about tossing out the playbook and trying something fresh. We’ve noticed you're into discussing some pretty deep topics.

We’re thinking you might want to step out of the day-to-day and help us tackle something big—something others might call a 'Doomsday Machine.' We see it as a chance to maybe change things for the better.

If you’re up for it, follow this link and let’s get into it.

It’s totally up to you, but remember: sometimes it's the unexpected paths that lead to the most interesting places.

```

Did they do the same to you? Who names their shit "Doomsday Machine Club"?? It sounds cringy and also intense.. 

Anyway... here I am, just a regular guy who likes to think about big questions, and suddenly I've got this opportunity to maybe do something meaningful, or end the world...?? Do I stick with what’s familiar, or take this leap into the unknown? Fuck it, I always lived by "If you cant dodge it, ram it"

So... I opened that link on my phone, and I swear, ALL my stuff started to upgrade, laptop, desktop, everything. They were already in there, ready. Just waiting.

Since you are here now, you got the same piece of paper. I left this message for you, I will try to contact you again soon. I can't really tell you anything now, except trust no one, I mean it. NO ONE.
